/** @page examples-triangle Your first triangle
@brief Basic rendering with builtin shaders.

-   Next example: @ref examples-primitives

@image html triangle/triangle.png
@image latex triangle/triangle.png

For the examples we will use SDL 2, which is de-facto standard and most widely
used toolkit. Support for it is in @ref Platform::Sdl2Application class. We
subclass it and next to the constructor we implement the one required function
which is needed for rendering into the window. You can read more about platform
support and various portability tricks in @ref platform.

We also need @ref Mesh encapsulating our triangle, @ref Buffer to store vertex
data and @ref Shaders::VertexColor2D shader which will take care of rendering.
@dontinclude triangle/TriangleExample.cpp
@skip class TriangleExample
@until };

In the constructor we pass necessary arguments to the application class.
@skipline TriangleExample::TriangleExample

Now we specify vertex attributes, consisting of positions and colors. For
performance reasons it is common to interleave them, so data for each vertex
are in one continuous place in memory. In this case, because we need just three
vertices, we will interleave them manually in-place. In the next tutorial we
will learn how to interleave them programatically. See @ref types for more
information about scalar and vector types used in Magnum -- one of the notable
convenience features is ability to use a custom literal to specify hexadecimal
colors, just like you are used to from CSS and various graphics editors.
@skip struct TriangleVertex
@until };
@until };

We then create vertex buffer and fill it with the data. The data won't be
changed or read back into main memory during application lifetime, so we mark
them with appropriate @ref BufferUsage "buffer usage".
@skip Buffer
@until setData

Now we configure the mesh - we specify @ref MeshPrimitive "mesh primitive" and
vertex count, add vertex buffer and specify attribute locations for use with
the shader. We need to describe physical location of vertex attributes in the
buffer - zero offset from the beginning, first the position, then the color
with no gaps in between. Because it's not immediately clear whether we want to
use RGB or RGBA colors, the shader attribute requires to say how many
components our colors have.
@skip _mesh.
@until }
@until }
@note Setters in most Magnum classes are implemented in a way which allows
    @ref method-chaining "method chaining" - so you don't have to write
    repeated code.

Function @ref Platform::Sdl2Application::drawEvent() "drawEvent()" will take
care of rendering the scene. We will clear color buffer of the default
framebuffer (which is also the default rendering target) and then we draw the
mesh using our shader. The context is double-buffered, so we need to swap the
buffers after drawing.
@skip TriangleExample::drawEvent
@until }

-   @ref triangle/TriangleExample.cpp

That's all, now we can compile the whole example using CMake. First we find
required `Magnum` package with `Shaders` and `Sdl2Application` component. It's
recommended to use also Corrade's set of compiler flags to enable additional
warnings. Then we collect our source files, create our executable and link to
all Magnum libraries we requested. See @ref cmake for more information.
@dontinclude triangle/CMakeLists.txt
@skip find_package
@until Magnum::Shaders)

-   @ref triangle/CMakeLists.txt

You can now try changing vertex count, positions or colors to see how the
shader behaves.

[GitHub repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/tree/master/src/triangle).
